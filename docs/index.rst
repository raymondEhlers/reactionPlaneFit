The Reaction Plane Fit (RPF) package implements the Reaction Plane Fit method described in `Phys. Rev. C 93,
044915 <https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.93.044915>`_ (or on the `arxiv
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04732>`_), with an additional extension to fitting the near and away-side signals.
The package implements the three reaction plane orientation fit, but extensions to further sets of
orientations requires just writing down the background fit function and defining the reaction plane
orientation properties.

For further information on the purpose of the package, quick start information, as well as an example, please see
the :doc:`README <about>`. **Documentation of the RPF package** is available on the :doc:`detailed code documentation
<documentation>` page.
